# Before_After
Simlpe game

There are two or more users and several cards with important historical events. At each step, players see two cards and each must choose which of the events happened first. If all the players answered correctly, everyone gets one point, and if someone makes a mistake, they don't get points, and the others get two points. The game ends when someone scores 15 points
